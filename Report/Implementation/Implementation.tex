\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}
IFC is yet to be more than just a toy-language, however in the design of the language and the actual compiler, we have tried to focus making the code modular and easy to extend.
Currently the program consists of four parts. Each part will carry out a seperate task for the program. We have focused on the making the code modular, such that each part does not explicitly dependent on the other part. Though the main interface is setup to the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Parser:} Extract the Abstract Syntax Tree generated in the Parser
  \item \textbf{Evaluator:} Run a program with an initial store
  \item \textbf{Verification Condition Generator:} Extract the formula by Verification Condition Generator
  \item \textbf{External SMT-solver API:} Run the formular through an external prover (Z3).
\end{enumerate}
Although each part can work seperately, they are connected as seen in \autoref{fig:flow} in the application.

\autoref{sec:guide} explains how to interact with the application. In the following sections we describe how each the four program parts are implemented. \autoref{sec:interface}, describe an interface which allows for more general proofs about programs.
