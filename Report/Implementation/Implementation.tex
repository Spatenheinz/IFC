\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}
This section presents our implementation of an application for verification of programs, which we will refer to as \textit{IFC}.
%IFC is yet to be more than just a toy-language, however in the design of the language and the actual compiler, we have tried to focus making the code modular and easy to extend.
The application consists of four parts, and each part carry out a seperate task for the program. 
This is done to make the code modular, such that each part does not explicitly dependent on any other parts. 
The four parts of the application performs the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Parser:} Transforms an input program, written in \textit{While}, to an Abstract Syntax Tree
  \item \textbf{Interpreter:} Interprets a program, expressed by an AST, given an initial store
  \item \textbf{Verification Condition Generator:} Computes the Verification Condition formula of a program, expressed by an AST, using predicate transformer semantics
  \item \textbf{External SMT-solver API:} Run a verification condition formular through an external prover (Z3), to assert program correctness
\end{enumerate}
Although each part can work seperately, they are connected in the application, as seen in \cref{fig:flow}.

\cref{sec:guide} explains how to interact with the application. In the \cref{sec:parser} to \cref{sec:api} we describe key points of the implementation, and \cref{sec:interface} describes an interface which allows for more general proofs about programs.
