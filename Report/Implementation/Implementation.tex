\section{Implementation}
IFC is yet to be more than just a toy-language, however in the design of the language and the actual compiler, we have tried to focus making the code modular and easy to extend.
Currently the program consists of 4 parts.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Parser
  \item Evaluator
  \item Verification Condition Generator
  \item External SMT-solver API
\end{enumerate}
Each part will carry out a task for the program. There is no explicit dependency between any of these parts. Though the main interface is setup to the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Extract the Abstract Syntax Tree generated in the Parser
  \item Run a program with an initial store (TODO!!!! REALLY NEED THIS)
  \item Extract the formula by Verification Condition Generator
  \item Run the formular through an external prover (Z3).
\end{enumerate}
Section ?? explains each of these are used. In the following section we describe how each the 4 program parts are implemented.
