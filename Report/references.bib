abstract = {In this paper an attempt is made to explore the logical foundations of computer programming by use of techniques which were first applied in the study of geometry and have later been extended to other branches of mathematics. This involves the elucidation of sets of axioms and rules of inference which can be used in proofs of the properties of computer programs. Examples are given of such axioms and rules, and a formal proof of a simple theorem is displayed. Finally, it is argued that important advantage, both theoretical and practical, may follow from a pursuance of these topics.},

For the formal derivation of programs expressed in terms of these constructs, a calculus will be be shown.},

,abstract = { A simple ALGOL-like language is defined which includes conditional, while, and procedure call statements as well as blocks. A formal interpretive semantics and a Hoare style axiom system are given for the language. The axiom system is proved to be sound, and in a certain sense complete, relative to the interpretive semantics. The main new results are the completeness theorem, and a careful treatment of the procedure call rules for procedures with global variables in their declarations. }
