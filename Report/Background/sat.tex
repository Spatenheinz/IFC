A SAT solver is a program that can determine whether a boolean formula is satisfiable. The advantage of this is that is becomes possible to automatically verify whether very large logical formulae are satisfiable.
When given a boolean formula, a SAT solver will determine if there are values for the free variables which satisfy the formula. If this is not the case, the SAT solver comes up with a suiting counter example.

\textit{Satifiability modulo theories} is the problem of determining whether a mathematical formula is satisfiable, and thus generalizes the SAT problem. SMT solvers can take as input some first-order logic formula, and determine if it is satisfiable, similar to SAT solvers.
Verification condition generators are often coupled with SMT solvers, so that one can finde the weakest precondition of a program, and then use an SMT solver to determine whether the condition is satisfiable.

An example of an SMT solver is the \textit{Z3 Theorem Prover}, which is such a solver created by Microsoft. The goal of \textit{Z3} is to verify and analyse software. (wiki)
In our project we use \textit{Z3} to verify program, by first computing the \textit{wp} of the program, given the assertions provided by the user, and then feeding this to the SMT solver.
