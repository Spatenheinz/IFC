\section{Introduction}

% learning objectives

% We can explain how VC generation works, and how it can be used for automatically proving certains properties about programs

% Can take a semantic, in form of inference rules, and translate it into concise and correct Haskell code

% Can write modular Haskell code that uses monad transformer stack to enable good seperation of concerns

% Attempted to support our claim of the correctness of our program by using automated testing

% The goal was to implement an assertion language that can be extended with the PER logic
