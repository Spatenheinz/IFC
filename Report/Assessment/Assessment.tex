\section{Assessment}\label{sec:assessment}
In this section, we make an assessment of the correctness of our implemention of the interpreter and verification condition generator for \textit{While}.
We also assess the robustness and maintenance of the implementation, especially regarding any possible extension of the implementation.
To support the assessment, we have designed a test suite consisting of both automated tests, blackbox tests, and test programs.
In \cref{sec:experiments}, we present the experiments conducted as part of the testing strategy, and in \cref{sec:evaluation} we assess the code based on the results of the tests, and perform a collective evaluation of our work.
