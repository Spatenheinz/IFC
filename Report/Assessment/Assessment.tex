\section{Assessment}
In this section, we make an assessment of our implemention of the interpreter and verification condition generator for \textit{While}. To assess the implementation, we have designed a test suite consisting of both automated tests, blackbox tests, and test programs.
In \autoref{sec:experiments}, we present the experiments conducted as part of the testing strategy, and in \autoref{sec:evaluation} we assess the code based on the results of the tests, and perform an evaluation of the work as a whole.
