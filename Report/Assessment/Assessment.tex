\section{Assessment}
In this section, we make an assessment of our implemention of the interpreter and verification condition generator for \textit{While}. To assess the implementation, we have designed a test suite consisting of both automated tests, blackbox tests, and test programs.
In this section, we present the testing strategy, makes an assessment partly based on the results of the tests, and makes suggestions for future extension of the implementation.

\subsection{Experiments}

%% Vi har fundet flere bugs gennem QC. s√• som undefined for ghosts. ikke checke for div by 0 in formula generation.

\subsection{Evaluation}
From the result presented in this Section, we have a fairly good solution, and our program actually works as intended on the example programs.
In fact most of the problems that still persists in the code is related to the tests, which could be of better quality. Despite this the Quickcheck tests have been useful in finding subtle bugs.
% *** Failed! Falsified (after 4 tests):
%         Assign "c" (ABinary Mod (IntConst (-3)) (IntConst 0))
%         Use --quickcheck-replay=775220 to reproduce.
%         Use -p '/Eval ~ VC-SAT/' to rerun this test only.
