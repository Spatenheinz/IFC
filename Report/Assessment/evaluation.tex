% something about evaluation
% NOTE: Here we will discuss the results of our tests.
% TODO: where to talk about the results of these example programs in depth?
% What results do we get? (more in-depth than in the intro to the section)


%From the result presented in this Section, we have a fairly good solution, and our program actually works as intended on the example programs.
%In fact most of the problems that still persists in the code is related to the tests, which could be of better quality. Despite this the Quickcheck tests have been useful in finding subtle bugs.
% *** Failed! Falsified (after 4 tests):
%         Assign "c" (ABinary Mod (IntConst (-3)) (IntConst 0))
%         Use --quickcheck-replay=775220 to reproduce.
%         Use -p '/Eval ~ VC-SAT/' to rerun this test only.
