We have conducted a smaller variety of tests. The tests includes both some testing of properties thorugh QuickCheck along with some examples program.
The examples can be found in the \verb\examples\ folder. Of these some works correctly and some intentionally dont. In the table below, each program can be seen along with a short description on how and why they are included.

\begin{tabular}{|c|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|}

  program\footnote{is this a bad way of representation?} & description & meaning \\
  \hline
  always_wrong & This program is simply a \verb\violate\ statement and should thus always fail. & This is simply to check that violate always makes the store invalid. This Likewise can never be verified.\\
  % assign & This program simply assigns two variables. & Both the evaluator and vc works as intended.\\
  % collatz & This program calculates the length of collatz-conjecture until the repeating pattern $1, 4, 2, 1,...$. & This is mostly a really bad example as we cannot do any reasonable assertions about the result or the while loop. & Despite the program have some hardcoded assertions meaning it at the momoent only works on input $n=11$, and cannot be proved. This shows that there indeed are ``problems'' which our language is not expressive enough to handle.\\
