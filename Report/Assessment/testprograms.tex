  program & description & results \\
  \hline
  always_wrong & 
	This program is simply a \verb\violate\ statement and should thus always fail. & 
  The interpreter evaluates to \verb\false\, and the VC generator gives a falsifiable verification condition. \\
	\hline
  assign & 
	Assigns values to two variables, and asserts that they get assigned correctly. &
	The interpreter gives the expected result, and the VC genration gives a solvable verification condition. \\
 	\hline
 	collatz & 
 	This program calculates the length of the collatz-conjecture until the repeating pattern $1, 4, 2, 1,...$. & 
   TODO: something cooler \\
 	\hline
%   % collatz &  & This is mostly a really bad example as we cannot do any reasonable assertions about the result or the while loop. & Despite the program have some hardcoded assertions meaning it at the momoent only works on input $n=11$, and cannot be proved. This shows that there indeed are ``problems'' which our language is not expressive enough to handle.\\
% 	\hline
 	div & 
   Takes as input two variables $a,b$ and computes the euclidean division of $a$ by $b$. & 
   The interpreter gives the expected result, and the VC generator generates a provable verification condition. \\
 	\hline
 	fac &
   Takes as input an integer $r$ and computes $r!$. & 
   TODO: fix invariant and variant ala sum program maybe \\
 	\hline
 	fib &
   Takes as input an integer $a$, and computes the $a$'th Fibonacci number. & 
   The evaulator gives the expected result, but the VC generator falsifies the computed verification condition. \\
%, most likely because the assertions in the program are insufficient to compute a good verification condition. \\
 	\hline
 	mult &
   Takes as input two variables $q,r$ and multiplies them. & 
   The interpreter gives the expected result, and the VC generator computes a provable verification condition. \\
 	\hline
 	max &
   Takes as input two variables $x,y$ and finds the maximum of the two. & 
   The interpreter gives the expected result, and the VC generator computes a provable verification condition. \\
 	\hline
 	skip &
   Asserts that the store is unchanged when executing a \texttt{skip} command. & 
   The interpreter gives the expected result, and the VC generator computes a provable verification condition. \\
 	\hline
 	sum & 
   Takes as input a positive integer $n$ and computes the sum from $1$ to $n$. & 
   The interpreter gives the expected result, and the VC generator computes a provable verification condition. \\
 	\hline
 	generic_sum & 
   Takes as input three integers $cur, lim, step$ and computes the sum of all numbers in a list starting in $cur$, stepping $step$, up to $lim$. &
   TODO: clean-up code and run tests \\
 	\hline
 	??? & 
   Tests something with undefined behaviour &
   Does something \\
