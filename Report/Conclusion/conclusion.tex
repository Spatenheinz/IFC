\section{Discussion and conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We have in this report presented the background for our project, which includes both the formal specification of the language, the axiomatic systems for Floyd-Hoare logic and the predicate transformer semantics which we use to generate verification conditions for a program. We have presented our implementation and our design choices for the program
