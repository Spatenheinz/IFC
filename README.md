This project implements a simple While language with a built in assertion-language.
With this combination, we can generate verification conditions for while-programs using predicate transformer semantics.
This can be discharged to an SMT-solver, which can then potentially validate the programs to show correctness.
Ideally this will be a base for which future projects can extended such that assertions can be used to reason about Information Flow Control.

This is done as a Project Outside of Course-scope at the University of Copenhagen.
